# Fuse Core

**A lightweight Jekyll theme for single-page personal websites.**

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme is for you if you need a personal website that simply
summarizes the links to your social media profiles and external content. It is:

- *responsive* - adapts to all screen sizes
- *mobile-friendly*
- *lightweight* - no JavaScript (except for Google Analytics, if enabled)
- *easy to configure* - no HTML knowledge required, just change *_config.yml*
- *fast* - All third party components loaded via their CDN (with
  [subresource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)),
  so most resources are already cached from visits to other websites.
- Optional Google Analytics supported, with IP anonymization and cookie consent popup
  (optional, but these things are helpful to comply with EU data protection laws).
  You'll need a Google Analytics account, of course, and set it up correctly first.

## Ancestry

The visual design for this theme is taken from the
[front-cover](https://github.com/dashingcode/front-cover) theme by [Dashingcode](https://github.com/dashingcode).
Big thank you, it looks awesome!

However, the *Fuse Core* theme is a complete reimplementation, which makes it very different on the inside.
There are many improvements big and small over front-cover, making *Fuse Core* a kind of "Front Cover 2.0" or
"Front Cover Plus":

- Ability to show "featured" links in a separate row of icons. Featured link icons optionally have captions and
  may point anywhere. They also have their own icons chosen from all of Font Awesome's solid icons.
- Use of Bootstrap for responsive design. This gives us supreme browser compatibility and ease of maintenance,
  because a myriad of problems are already handled by the folks at Bootstrap.
- Up-to-date libraries, especially Font Awesome 5.
- Support for [Google Analytics ](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), including some legal details
  such as IP anonymization and cookie consent popup (all optional).
- Search engine control via configurable meta tags
- Responsive sticky footer
